How to ensure deadlines:

Use Agile sprints, prioritize tasks, track progress with tools like Jira, manage risks proactively, and maintain open communication.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?

Contribution to success:

Prevents financial waste, ensures profitability, and aligns with stakeholder expectations.
Strategies:

Regular budget reviews, scope control, resource optimization, and contingency planning.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile:

Pros: Flexible, iterative, customer feedback-driven. Cons: Less predictable timelines.

Waterfall:

Pros: Structured, clear milestones. Cons: Inflexible to changes post-planning.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile: Startups, apps with evolving requirements (e.g., social media platforms).
Waterfall: Regulated industries (e.g., healthcare software with fixed compliance needs).

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods:

Automated testing, continuous integration (CI/CD), peer reviews, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Importance:

Reduces bugs, enhances user satisfaction, and avoids costly post-launch fixes.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Scope contribution:

Clarifies goals, avoids scope creep, and aligns stakeholders.
WBS:

Hierarchical task breakdown; ensures no detail is overlooked and simplifies delegation.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Benefits:

Visualizes timelines, identifies dependencies, and tracks progress.
Gantt charts:

Display task durations, overlaps, and milestones in a timeline format.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

Issue: Inefficient manual workflows in small businesses.

Significance: Saves time, reduces errors, and cuts operational costs for time-strapped teams.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

Clarifies pain points, guides solution design, and ensures alignment with user needs (e.g., automating repetitive tasks).

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

"A user-friendly platform that automates invoicing and expense tracking for freelancers, eliminating manual data entry."

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

AI-driven insights, real-time collaboration, and one-click integrations with accounting tools.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?

Trends: Remote work ↑, demand for automation tools.

Positioning: Highlight ease-of-use and mobile-first design to align with freelance mobility needs
